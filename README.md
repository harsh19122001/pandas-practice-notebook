# Pandas Practice Set

This repository contains my complete practice work for **Pandas**, where I learned how to handle, clean and analyze data using Python.  
Pandas is one of the most important libraries for Data Science, Machine Learning and analytics, and these exercises helped me build a strong foundation.

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Importing and installing Pandas
- Creating and working with Series
- Indexing and slicing (`loc`, `iloc`)
- Reading CSV and Excel files
- Exploring data (`head`, `tail`, `info`, `shape`, `describe`)
- Selecting columns and rows
- Dropping and renaming columns
- Creating new columns and doing calculations
- Checking unique values and value counts
- Handling missing values (`dropna`, `fillna`, mean/median, ffill, bfill)
- Replacing values
- Removing duplicates
- Using `apply()` and lambda functions
- Splitting strings into new columns
- Concatenating DataFrames
- Merging datasets
- Sorting and resetting index
- GroupBy (mean, sum, count, min, max)
- Using multiple operations with `agg`

## 📚 Goal of This Practice

My goal is to strengthen my:

- Data cleaning skills  
- Data transformation skills  
- Logical thinking  
- Real-world data analysis workflow  
- Foundations for EDA, ML, and AI  

I will keep adding more practice files as I continue my Data Science journey.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📄 Files in This Repository

- `pandas_practice_set.ipynb` — main practice notebook  
- Additional files will be added as I learn more  

## 🚀 Learning Journey

I am continuously improving my data skills through practice, assignments, and projects.  
Always learning. Always growing.

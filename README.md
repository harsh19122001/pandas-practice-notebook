# pandas-practice-notebook
This repository contains my Pandas practice. Here I have learned how to read data, clean data, select rows and columns, handle missing values, sort data, merge datasets, use groupby, and do basic data analysis. I will keep adding more practice and examples as I continue learning Data Science.
